# 🥪 DELI-cious – Sandwich Shop Ordering App (Java CLI Project)

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to **DELI-cious**, a fun and colorful sandwich shop ordering app I built in Java. If you've ever walked into a deli and thought, “I just want to build my sandwich, pick a drink, and go,” then you're in the right place.

This app lets users build custom sandwiches by picking bread, meats, cheese, toppings, and sauces, just like in a real sandwich shop. They can also add drinks and chips, review their order, and get a receipt saved to the system — all from a simple and friendly command-line interface.

## 🧾 What This App Does

### 👤 For Customers:
You can walk through a virtual ordering experience that feels like a real deli:

- Choose **dine-in or takeout**
- Pick your **bread** (like white, wheat, rye, or wrap)
- Choose sandwich **size** (4”, 8”, 12”)
- Add **meats**, **cheeses**, **regular toppings**, and **sauces**
- Ask for **extras** (like extra bacon or cheese)
- Decide if you want your sandwich **toasted**
- Add a **drink** and **chips**
- Confirm your order and receive a **receipt with the total price and timestamp**

At the end, the app prints a clean receipt and saves it to a file so it's like a real POS (Point-of-Sale) system.

## 🛠️ How It Was Built

This app was made using **Java** and built entirely in the terminal (CLI = Command Line Interface). It uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — a method that organizes code into reusable building blocks called "classes."

Some of the major concepts used:

- **Encapsulation**: Keeps each feature self-contained (e.g., drinks, chips, bread all have their own logic)
- **Inheritance**: Signature sandwiches are based on the standard sandwich class but have their own fixed ingredients
- **Polymorphism**: The receipt treats everything (sandwich, chips, drinks) as a `MenuProduct` — even though they behave differently behind the scenes
- **Abstraction**: Things like pricing, extras, and categories are all simplified through helpful classes and methods
